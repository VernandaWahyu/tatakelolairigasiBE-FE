## Features
- Automated irrigation based on soil moisture and weather conditions.
- Remote control via mobile or web interface.
- Data logging of environmental parameters (soil moisture, temperature, humidity).
- Adjustable threshold levels for irrigation.
- Real-time monitoring and notifications.
- Energy-efficient operation using solar power (optional).

## System Architecture
1. **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensors, temperature, and humidity sensors monitor the environmental conditions.
2. **Controller**: A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) processes sensor data and controls the water pump based on predefined thresholds.
3. **Actuator**: A water pump or valve that is activated based on the irrigation needs.
4. **Communication**: Data is sent to a cloud server or local server for logging and remote control via Wi-Fi or GSM module.
5. **User Interface**: A mobile/web interface to monitor the system and control irrigation manually.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino/ESP32, Soil Moisture Sensor, Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11/22), Relay Module, Water Pump/Valve.
- **Software**:
  - Microcontroller Programming: Arduino IDE.
  - Backend: Javascript.
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js optional).
  - Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL.
